This is what I've learnt after learning a bit about notion

1. Everything in notion is a block.

## Page

A page is a special type of block which contain other blocks included pages known as subpages.

## CollectionViewPage

1. A CollectionViewPage is also a special type of page, which has been converted into a full page database.
2. Every CollectionViewPage has a collection related to it which contains various informations including the schema of the database.
3. A CollectionViewPage can contain multiple views
4. A CollectionViewPage and CollectionView are quite similar apart from the fact that
  1. CollectionView is not a page
  2. CollectionView is an inline database, while CollectionViewPage is a full-page database

## CollectionView

1. A special type of block that has similar functionalities to that of a CollectionViewPage
2. It can be embedded inside a page as a block
